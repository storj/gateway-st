Storj is building a decentralized cloud storage network. [Check out our white
paper for more info!](https://storj.io/white-paper)

----

Storj is an S3-compatible platform and suite of decentralized applications that
allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. Your files are
encrypted, broken into little pieces and stored in a global decentralized
network of computers. Luckily, we also support allowing you (and only you) to
retrieve those files!

## Documentation

* [Using the S3 Gateway](https://docs.storj.io/api-reference/s3-gateway)

Table](https://docs.storj.io/dcs/api/s3/s3-compatibility).

## Testing

### Correctness

A suite of integration tests can be run on the checked out code.

`make integration-run` will start a new integration environment using Docker
and run all the integration tests.

At the end of the run, you can run `make integration-env-purge` to remove the
integration environment.

This requires `docker` to be installed on your local machine for this to work.

#### mint

We run mint tests based on MinIO's mint
([gateway-mint](https://github.com/storj/gateway-mint)) on every commit.

To run the tests:

`make integration-env-start integration-mint-tests`

You can also run a specific test using the `TEST` environment variable:

`TEST=aws-sdk-php make integration-mint-tests`

#### ceph/splunk-s3-tests

We run S3 tests based on Splunk's fork (which is better suited for us) of
Ceph's S3 tests ([splunk-s3-tests](https://github.com/storj/splunk-s3-tests)) on
every commit.

To run the tests:

`make integration-env-start integration-splunk-tests`
